# **React Code Challenge**

This is a simple react application that consists of two components, a Parent and a Child. Upon running the app you will see one button. Pressing this button will update a counter on the Parent component. Functionally it works.

There are two rendering issues, one affects both the Parent and the Child and one just affects the Child. Your job is to diagnose the problem as far as you can.

The challenge is intentionally difficult, fully solving the problem is not required, the most important thing is your process. Feel free to use whatever resources you have available to prepare for this challenge, just as you might do if you were trying to solve this problem at work. You are also welcome to rewrite any or all of the code.

## **Submitting This Challenge**

Please email back a Pull Request link to a public repository (like your personal Github account) with all changes in a single PR.

To prepare for this challenge:

- [ ] Unzip the emailed code challenge locally
- [ ] Push it to a public Github repo as is ([Github instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/migrations/importing-source-code/using-the-command-line-to-import-source-code/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github#initializing-a-git-repository))
- [ ] Then create a branch, work on that branch (_git checkout \-b my-code-challenge_)

To submit the challenge:

- [ ] Push your branch up (_git push \--set-upstream origin my-code-challenge_)
- [ ] Create a PR from the branch ([Github instructions](http://my-code-challenge))

Be prepared to share your screen, with an editor showing this code, during the interview. You will be asked to talk about your process and ultimate conclusion.
